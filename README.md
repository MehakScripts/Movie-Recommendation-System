# Movie-Recommendation-System
Movie Recommendation System built with Python using TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity

# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System
A **Movie Recommendation System** that suggests movies to users based on their preferences using **content-based filtering** and **similarity techniques**. This project demonstrates practical use of data preprocessing, feature extraction, and recommendation logic.

## 📌 Project Overview

With the increasing number of movies available online, users often find it difficult to choose what to watch. This system recommends movies similar to the one selected by the user based on genres, keywords, and descriptions.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
* **Algorithm:** Content-Based Filtering
* **Similarity Measure:** Cosine Similarity

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Load and preprocess the movie dataset
2. Combine important features such as genre, overview, and keywords
3. Convert text data into vectors using **CountVectorizer / TF-IDF**
4. Calculate similarity using **Cosine Similarity**
5. Recommend top similar movies based on user input

## ✨ Features

* Movie-to-movie recommendation
* Fast and accurate suggestions
* Easy to extend with collaborative filtering
* Beginner-friendly implementation

## 📊 Sample Output

```
Enter a movie name: Avatar
Recommended Movies:
1. Guardians of the Galaxy
2. Interstellar
3. Star Wars
4. Avengers
5. Inception
```

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

* Add collaborative filtering
* Integrate with a web interface (React / Flask)
* Improve recommendations using ML models
* User-based personalization
